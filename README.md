# pausemusic.sh
My shell script to pause Youtube videos and music system-wide with a mouse button

You have to put the pausemusic.sh in the /usr/bin/ directory and then execute the macroing.sh in the .xinit to be able to use this system-wide.

Edit the macroing.sh to change the button that triggers it.

Good luck mate.
